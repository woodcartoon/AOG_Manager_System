# AOG Manager

AOG Manager is a desktop application for managing church members, serving
teams, and service attendance. It runs with Electron and uses Firebase
Authentication for sign-in and Firebase SQL Connect for cloud data.

## What it does

- Sign in with a Firebase Authentication account.
- View and search members, filter by serving team, and add, edit, or remove
  member records.
- Refresh to fetch the latest member data from the database.
- Submit a service and select the members who attended. The app records each
  attendance and updates the member's attendance total.
- Support multiple organizations for an account, with organization access
  controlled by its membership.

Standard serving teams are General, Pastor, Youth Pastor, Worshiper, Usher,
Band, and Sound Team.

## Database structure

The database is relational. Firebase SQL Connect stores it in Cloud SQL for
PostgreSQL. The diagram below shows the main tables and relationships.

        Boolean active
        Int64 servicesAttendedCount
        Timestamp lastAttendedDate
    }
    SERVICE {
        UUID id PK
        UUID orgId FK
        Timestamp date
        String type
        Boolean isActive
    }
    ATTENDANCE {
        UUID orgId FK
        UUID memberId PK, FK
        UUID serviceId PK, FK
        Timestamp timestamp
    }
```

`USER_ORGANIZATION` connects a Firebase Auth user to an organization and
stores their role. A member can have an optional serving team. `ATTENDANCE`
uses the member and service together as its key, so the same member cannot be
recorded twice for one service.

## How attendance works

When an authorized user submits a service, the app saves the service, then
records each selected member's attendance. Each attendance record and its
member's attendance-count update are saved together in a database transaction.
If the connection interrupts the submission, the app can retry without
re-recording attendance that has already been saved.

SQL Connect operations check that the signed-in user belongs to the selected
organization. Changes to members, services, and attendance are restricted to
users with the `ADMIN` or `TEAM_LEAD` role.

## Run the application

From the project folder:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Firebase Authentication, SQL Connect deployment, and first-organization setup
are required. Follow [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for the full setup
instructions and deployment commands.

The main database definition is in
[dataconnect/schema/schema.gql](dataconnect/schema/schema.gql). SQL Connect
queries and mutations are in [dataconnect/connector](dataconnect/connector).
